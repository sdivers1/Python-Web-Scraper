# Python-Web-Scraper

##What is this project about?

This project is a Python Web Scraper project that scrapes information on the web and then stores it in appropriate columns in a csv file. In this particular project, I have used data from a Real Estate website indicating the listing of various houses in my neighbourhood in the order of less expensive to most expensive.
This project demonstrates my understanding of Python, Data Structures, and uses real world data to find something meaningful. 

##How to run this project?

To run this project, you will need to download Python on your computer.

After that you will have to create an environment in Python which uses Beautiful Soup to extract the required information.
If you just want to see the outcome of this project, please refer to the csv file I have attached in the repository.
